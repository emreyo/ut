youtube mp3 downloader written in bash

uses youtube-dl. needs root permission to copy itself into ~/bin/ and install youtube-dl if not present in the system. if you don't want to give root privileges, just install youtube-dl and create ~/bin/. 

if you get errors, they're either because you installed youtube-dl from repository or because you don't have proper codecs. google error message and find it. 

pull requests are welcome. 

i hope this helps someone.
